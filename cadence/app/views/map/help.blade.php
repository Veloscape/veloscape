        <h3>Using the Veloscape Map</h3>
        <p>
            Share your cycling experiences with us by mapping your journeys on the veloscape map. 
            Place markers on the map to plot out your routes by either <b>left clicking</b> on the map 
            or using the <b class="blue">SEARCH LOCATION</b> button. 
            Markers can be dragged around to re-position them if required.
            Keep dropping new markers until you've mapped out your entire journey!

            The <b class="blue">RESET MAP</b> button can be used to clear away all markers you've made and start from the beginning.
            When you're happy with your map, click on the <b class="blue">SUBMIT</b> button and give your journey a name 
            (eg: Ashfield to the CBD). Hit <b class="blue">confirm</b> to complete your response, its that easy.
