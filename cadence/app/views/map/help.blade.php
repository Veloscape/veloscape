        <h3>Using the Veloscape Map</h3>
        <p>
            Share your cycling experiences with us by mapping your journeys on the veloscape map. 
            Place Markers on the map to plot out your routes by either Left Clicking on the map 
            or using the Search Location button. 
            Markers can be dragged around to re-position them if required.
            Keep dropping new Markers until you've mapped out your entire journey!
