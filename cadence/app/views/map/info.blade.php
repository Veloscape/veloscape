            Veloscape is an art research project about cycling in Sydney, and we want you to be part of it!</br> 
            Use this page to share your impressions of your cycling journeys: tell us about a single location, or map an extended route.</br> 
            You’ll be providing data to the City of Sydney and other councils to help them improve their cycling infrastructure. </br>
            You’ll also be helping us to create public artworks that explore how Sydney is experienced by bike.
